# Fetch Take Home Challenge

## How to run the API
1. Run `docker pull janyoo99/fetch-nodejs:0.0.1.RELEASE` to pull the Docker image for this project.
2. Run `docker run -d -p 5500:5500 janyoo99/fetch-nodejs:0.0.1.RELEASE` to spin up the container - the application will run on port 5500.
3. The API should now be running on localhost:5500!

Admittedly, I don't have much experience with Docker, so please bear with me if there are any hiccups in the instructions!
